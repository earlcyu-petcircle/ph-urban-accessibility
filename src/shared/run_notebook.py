"""
Execute a notebook in place and save it with its outputs, as 03_analyse.sh does for each
analysis notebook.

Each cell's printed output is merged into one stream. The kernel otherwise splits a cell's
prints into several output blocks depending on timing, so the same run could save a different
file. nbclient's coalesce_streams option does this, but nbconvert's command line cannot set it.

Usage:  .venv/bin/python src/shared/run_notebook.py notebooks/<name>.ipynb
